## Architecture Overview

This is a Flask web application for collaborative multi-user voting on note classifications in manuscript records. The application uses a modular Blueprint-based architecture with SQLite database backend.

### System Architecture

**Application Factory Pattern:**
- `app.py` - Creates and configures the Flask application
- Registers blueprints for modular route organization
- Initializes SQLAlchemy database connection
- Configures session management

**Database Layer (SQLAlchemy ORM):**
- `models.py` - Database models and relationships
  - `User` - User accounts with password_hash and admin flag
  - `Record` - Manuscript records with bib_id
  - `Note` - Individual notes within records
  - `Vote` - User votes on note classifications
  - `Setting` - Configurable system settings
- SQLite database: `instance/classification.db`
- One vote per user per note (unique constraint)
- Cascading deletes for data integrity

**Authentication System:**
- `auth.py` - Password-based authentication
- Passwords stored as secure hashes using werkzeug.security
- New users: password set on account creation
- Existing users: password validated on login
- Legacy users: can set password on first login after migration
- Session-based with 7-day persistence
- Auto-grants admin to username "Admin" (case-insensitive)
- Decorators: `@login_required`, `@admin_required`

**Route Blueprints:**

1. **`routes/main.py`** - Record browsing and navigation
   - `/` - Index page with all records
   - `/record/<bib_id>` - Record detail with voting interface
   - `/start-unclassified` - Jump to first unclassified note
   - `/next-unclassified/<bib>` - Navigate to next unclassified
   - `/next-unknown/<bib>` - Navigate to next unknown consensus
   - `/next-pending-review/<bib>` - Navigate to next unvoted note

2. **`routes/voting.py`** - Vote submission endpoints
   - `POST /vote` - Submit or update single note vote
   - `POST /vote-identical` - Bulk vote on all identical notes
   - Returns vote distribution, consensus, and voter data

3. **`routes/filters.py`** - Filtered views
   - `/unknown` - Records with "?" consensus
   - `/pending-review` - Records needing user's vote
   - `/contentious` - Records below consensus threshold

4. **`routes/admin.py`** - Admin interface (requires `@admin_required`)
   - `/admin/dashboard` - Statistics and top contributors
   - `/admin/users` - User management (edit usernames, merge accounts)
   - `/admin/users/<id>/edit` - Edit username or merge with existing user
   - `/admin/upload` - XML import interface
   - `/admin/export` - XML export with confidence filter and minimum votes
   - `/admin/settings` - Configure contentious threshold and min votes

**Business Logic:**

- `utils/probability.py` - Core voting logic
  - `calculate_vote_distribution(note_id)` - Computes consensus from votes
  - `get_user_vote_for_note(user_id, note_id)` - Retrieves user's vote
  - `count_identical_notes(note_text)` - Finds duplicate notes
  - `get_identical_note_ids(note_text)` - Returns IDs of matching notes
  - Consensus calculation: highest vote count, ties broken alphabetically
  - Contentious detection: consensus < threshold AND votes >= min_votes

- `utils/xml_parser.py` - XML import functionality
  - Parses XML records and notes into database
  - Optionally creates initial votes from existing classifications
  - Idempotent: skips duplicate records

- `utils/xml_exporter.py` - XML export functionality
  - Exports records with consensus classifications
  - Filters by confidence threshold AND minimum votes
  - Excludes records with no qualifying notes
  - Includes vote statistics as attributes

**Frontend:**
- `templates/` - Jinja2 templates with Bootstrap 5
  - `base.html` - Base template with navigation
  - `index.html` - Landing page with classification legend and getting started section
  - `record.html` - Main voting interface with progress meters
  - `login.html` - Login page with username and password fields
  - `admin/` - Admin interface templates (dashboard, users, export, upload, settings)
- `static/js/app.js` - Client-side JavaScript
  - Vote submission via AJAX
  - Dynamic UI updates for vote distributions
  - Vote visibility toggle
  - Bulk voting for identical notes (checkbox state preserved)
  - No keyboard navigation (removed for browser compatibility)
- `static/css/style.css` - Custom styling

### Classification System

The app supports 7 classification types for manuscript notes:
- **W** (Work) - Content related to the work itself
- **O** (Object) - Physical description of the manuscript
- **A** (Administrative) - Cataloging or processing information
- **OW** (Object/Work) - Combined physical and content description
- **AW** (Administrative/Work) - Combined administrative and content information
- **AO** (Administrative/Object) - Combined administrative and physical information
- **?** (Unknown) - Classification unclear or uncertain

### Multi-User Voting Flow

1. **User logs in** with username and password
2. **Navigates to record** with notes needing classification (typically using "Next Unclassified" button)
3. **Submits vote** by clicking classification button
4. **AJAX request** sent to `/vote` endpoint with:
   - `bib_id` - Record identifier
   - `note_index` - Note position within record
   - `classification` - Selected classification type
5. **Backend processing**:
   - Validates classification type
   - Creates or updates vote in database
   - Calculates new vote distribution
   - Determines consensus (highest vote count)
   - Checks if contentious (< threshold with >= min votes)
   - Retrieves all voters for the note
6. **JSON response** returned with:
   - Vote distribution (counts and probabilities)
   - Consensus classification and confidence
   - Contentious flag
   - Voter data (grouped by classification)
7. **Frontend updates**:
   - Vote distribution display
   - "Who Voted?" section
   - Button highlighting for user's vote
   - Success notification

### Bulk Voting for Identical Notes

1. **Checkbox is checked by default** for notes with identical matches
2. **User submits vote** by clicking classification button
3. **AJAX request** sent to `/vote-identical` endpoint with:
   - `note_text` - Full text of the note
   - `classification` - Selected classification type
4. **Backend processing**:
   - Finds all notes with matching text
   - Creates or updates vote for each note
   - Commits all changes in single transaction
5. **JSON response** with:
   - Total notes affected
   - New votes created
   - Existing votes updated
6. **Notification** shows bulk operation summary

### Consensus Calculation Algorithm

```python
# Count votes per classification
vote_counts = {'w': 3, 'o': 2, 'a': 1}  # Example
total_votes = 6

# Calculate probabilities
probabilities = {
    'w': 3/6 = 0.50,  # 50%
    'o': 2/6 = 0.33,  # 33%
    'a': 1/6 = 0.17   # 17%
}

# Determine consensus (highest count, alphabetical tie-break)
consensus = 'w'
consensus_probability = 0.50

# Check if contentious
threshold = 0.70  # 70% from settings
min_votes = 3     # From settings
is_contentious = (total_votes >= 3 and 0.50 < 0.70)  # True
```

### Key Features

**Vote Privacy:**
- Other users' votes hidden by default
- "Show Other Votes" button toggles visibility
- Prevents vote bias before user makes decision

**Identical Notes Detection:**
- Badge shows "X identical" count
- Checkbox allows bulk voting on all identical notes
- Checkbox is checked by default and state is preserved after voting
- Finds matches based on exact text comparison

**Translation Integration:**
- Translate button (🌐) next to each note
- Opens Google Translate in new tab
- Auto-detects source language
- Pre-fills note text via URL encoding

**Contentious Detection:**
- Configurable threshold (default 70%)
- Configurable minimum votes (default 3)
- Visual badge on contentious notes
- Dedicated filter page for contentious records

**Admin Auto-Grant:**
- Username "Admin" (case-insensitive) automatically gets `is_admin=True`
- Applied to both new and existing users
- No manual database updates required

**Progress Tracking:**
- **Your voting progress**: Shows percentage of notes you've voted on
- **Overall completion progress**: Shows percentage of notes with at least one vote
- Real-time updates as votes are submitted
- Helps users track their contribution and project status

**User Management (Admin):**
- **Edit usernames**: Rename user accounts
- **Merge users**: Change username to existing user to merge all votes
- Automatic vote transfer during merge
- Useful for combining duplicate accounts or fixing typos

**Smart Navigation:**
- "Next Unclassified" button replaces generic "Next Record"
- Automatically finds notes the current user hasn't voted on
- Wraps around to beginning of records if needed
- Helps users focus on completing their work

2. Add color mapping in `utils/probability.py` (lines 196-205)
3. Update template in `templates/record.html` (buttons section)
4. Update JavaScript in `static/js/app.js` (color function)

**Adding a new filter view:**
1. Create route in `routes/filters.py`
2. Add navigation link in `templates/base.html`
3. Create template in `templates/`
4. Use `calculate_vote_distribution()` for consensus

**Modifying consensus algorithm:**
1. Edit `calculate_vote_distribution()` in `utils/probability.py`
2. Update tests if applicable
3. Consider migration for existing data

**Adding admin features:**
1. Create route in `routes/admin.py` with `@admin_required`
2. Add link to `templates/admin/dashboard.html`
3. Create template in `templates/admin/`

### Performance Considerations

**Database Queries:**
- Use `joinedload()` for eager loading votes
- Avoid N+1 queries in record lists
- Index on foreign keys (note_id, user_id)

**Caching Opportunities:**
- Vote distributions (invalidate on vote update)
- Identical note counts (invalidate on data import)
- User session data

**Optimization Tips:**
- Batch vote operations for identical notes
- Use database-level consensus calculation for large datasets
- Consider materialized views for statistics

### Common Issues

**Port 5000 Conflicts (macOS):**
- AirPlay Receiver service uses port 5000
- Solution: Use `python -c "from app import app; app.run(debug=True, port=8080)"`
- Alternative: Disable AirPlay Receiver in System Preferences

**Database Locked Errors:**
- SQLite doesn't handle concurrent writes well
- Enable WAL mode: `PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL;`
- Consider PostgreSQL for production

**Vote Display Not Updating:**
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify voters data included in JSON response
- Ensure `updateVotersDisplay()` function called

**Import Failures:**
- Verify XML is well-formed UTF-8
- Check for duplicate bib_id attributes
- Ensure special characters are properly encoded

### Testing

**Manual Testing Checklist:**
1. Login as regular user and admin with passwords
2. Create new user account (password auto-saved)
3. Vote on notes, verify distribution updates
4. Change vote, verify update works
5. Bulk vote on identical notes (checkbox should stay checked)
6. Verify progress meters update after voting
7. Check contentious detection with different thresholds
8. Import XML file
9. Export with different confidence thresholds and minimum votes
10. Test translation button
11. Use "Next Unclassified" navigation
12. Test user management (rename, merge users)
13. Check all filter views

**Database Testing:**
```python
# Test vote creation
from app import app, db
from models import User, Note, Vote

with app.app_context():
    user = User.query.first()
    note = Note.query.first()
    vote = Vote(note_id=note.id, user_id=user.id, classification='w')
    db.session.add(vote)
    db.session.commit()
```

### Security Considerations

**Authentication:**
- Passwords stored as secure hashes (pbkdf2:sha256)
- Passwords never stored in plain text
- New users set password on first login
- Legacy users can set password on next login after migration
- Suitable for team environments with moderate security needs

**Admin Access:**
- Auto-grant based on username "Admin" (case-insensitive)
- Anyone can create admin account by using "Admin" username
- Fine for internal tools, not for public deployment
- Consider more robust admin system for production

**Input Validation:**
- Classification types validated server-side
- Username length limited to 50 characters
- Note text properly escaped in templates

**SQL Injection:**
- Protected by SQLAlchemy ORM
- Never concatenate raw SQL with user input

### Future Enhancements

**Potential Features:**
- Email notifications for contentious notes
- Comment system for discussing classifications
- Vote change history/audit log
- Export to CSV for analysis
- REST API for external integrations
- PostgreSQL support for better concurrency
- Real-time updates with WebSockets
- Mobile-responsive improvements
- Keyboard shortcuts for voting (1-7 keys)
- Undo last vote action

**Performance Improvements:**
- Redis caching layer
- Background job queue for bulk operations
- Database query optimization with indexes
- Frontend pagination for large record sets

### Migration Notes

**From XML-based single-user system:**
1. Old system stored classifications directly in XML
2. New system uses database with voting
3. Migration script: `migrate_existing_data.py`
4. Preserves existing classifications as "Admin" votes
5. XML import/export maintains compatibility

**Adding password support to existing database:**
1. Run migration: `python migrate_add_passwords.py`
2. Adds `password_hash` column to users table
3. Existing users set password on next login
4. Safe to run multiple times (checks if column exists)
