# Classification Vote Web App

A Flask web application for collaborative voting on note classifications in manuscript records. Multiple users can vote on classifications, with automatic consensus calculation and contentious note detection.

## Features

### Multi-User Voting System
- **Collaborative classification**: Multiple users can vote on the same notes
- **Consensus calculation**: Automatic calculation of consensus based on vote distribution
- **Vote probability**: Shows percentage agreement for each classification
- **Contentious detection**: Flags notes where consensus is below configurable threshold
- **Vote history**: Track who voted for which classifications
- **Vote updates**: Users can change their vote at any time

### Classification Types
Seven classification types for manuscript notes:
- **Work (W)**: Content related to the work itself
- **Object (O)**: Physical description of the manuscript
- **Administrative (A)**: Cataloging or processing information
- **Object/Work (OW)**: Combined physical and content description
- **Administrative/Work (AW)**: Combined administrative and content information
- **Administrative/Object (AO)**: Combined administrative and physical information
- **Unknown (?)**: Classification unclear or uncertain

### User Features
- **Password authentication**: Secure login with username and password
- **Vote privacy**: Other users' votes hidden by default, optional to view
- **Bulk voting**: Vote on all identical notes at once (checkbox checked by default)
- **Translation**: Built-in Google Translate integration for foreign language notes
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress meters showing your voting progress and overall completion
- **Quick navigation**: Jump to next unclassified, unknown, or pending review record
- **Smart navigation**: "Next Unclassified" button automatically finds notes you haven't voted on

### Admin Features
Login with username "Admin" (case-insensitive) to access:
- **Dashboard**: Statistics on votes, users, and classifications
- **User Management**: Edit usernames and merge duplicate user accounts
- **XML Import**: Upload XML files to populate the database
- **XML Export**: Export classifications with configurable confidence threshold and minimum votes
- **Settings**: Adjust contentious threshold and minimum vote requirements

### Filtering and Navigation
- **Unclassified**: Records with no votes yet
- **Unknown**: Records with "?" consensus
- **Pending Review**: Records where current user hasn't voted
- **Contentious**: Records with low consensus agreement
- **Identical Notes**: Indicator showing how many records share the same note text

## Setup

### 1. Install UV
If you don't have UV installed:
```bash
# macOS/Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh

# Or with pip
pip install uv
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment and install packages
uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the Application
```bash
# The database will be initialized automatically on first run
python app.py
```

Open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

### 4. Migrate Existing Database (If Upgrading)
If you have an existing database and are upgrading to the password-enabled version:
```bash
python migrate_add_passwords.py
```

### 5. Import Data (Optional)
If you have an existing `data.xml` file:
```bash
# Run the migration script
python migrate_existing_data.py
```

Or use the admin interface to upload XML files after logging in.

### Port 5000 Issues (macOS)
If you encounter a "Port 5000 is in use" error on macOS, this is because AirPlay Receiver uses port 5000 by default.

**Option 1: Use a different port**
```bash
python -c "from app import app; app.run(debug=True, port=8080)"
```
Then visit `http://localhost:8080`

**Option 2: Disable AirPlay Receiver**
Go to **System Preferences → General → AirDrop & Handoff** and turn off "AirPlay Receiver"

## Usage

### For Regular Users

1. **Login**: Enter your username and password
   - New users: Your password will be saved automatically
   - Existing users: Enter your password to login
2. **Browse records**: Click "Start with Unclassified" to begin classifying
3. **Classify notes**:
   - Click the appropriate classification button (W, O, A, OW, AW, AO, or ?)
   - Optionally click "Show Other Votes" to see what others voted
   - Use the translate button (🌐) for foreign language notes
4. **Bulk voting**: The "Vote on all X identical notes" checkbox is checked by default for identical notes
5. **Navigate**: Use "Next Unclassified" button to move to the next record you haven't voted on
6. **Track progress**: View your personal voting progress and overall project completion at the top of each record

### For Administrators

1. **Login** as "Admin" (or "admin", "ADMIN" - case insensitive) with your password
2. **Access admin panel**: Click "Admin" in the navigation menu
3. **View statistics**: See total votes, users, and classification distribution
4. **Manage users**: Edit usernames or merge duplicate accounts
   - Click "Manage Users" in the admin dashboard
   - Edit usernames to rename or merge accounts
   - Merging transfers all votes to the target account
5. **Import XML**: Upload data.xml files to populate the database
6. **Export XML**: Download classifications with custom confidence threshold and minimum votes
7. **Configure settings**:
   - Adjust contentious threshold (default 70%)
   - Set minimum votes required for contentious detection (default 3)

### Understanding Consensus

- **Consensus**: The classification with the most votes
- **Confidence**: Percentage of votes for the consensus classification
- **Contentious**: Notes marked when consensus is below threshold with minimum votes
  - Example: With 70% threshold and 3 min votes, a note with 2 votes for "W" and 1 vote for "O" shows 67% confidence and is marked contentious

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite with the following tables:

- **users**: User accounts (username, password_hash, is_admin)
- **records**: Manuscript records (bib_id, title)
- **notes**: Individual notes within records (text, note_index)
- **votes**: User votes on notes (note_id, user_id, classification)
- **settings**: Configurable system settings (contentious threshold, min votes, export filters)

Database file: `instance/classification.db`

## XML Format

### Import Format
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<records>
  <record bib="unique_id">
    <title>Record title</title>
    <note type="w">Note content</note>
    <note type="o">Another note</note>
  </record>
</records>
```

### Export Format
```xml
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<records>
  <record bib="unique_id">
    <title>Record title</title>
    <note type="w" consensus_probability="0.85" vote_count="12">Note content</note>
    <note type="o" consensus_probability="0.67" vote_count="9">Another note</note>
  </record>
</records>
```

Only notes meeting both the confidence threshold and minimum vote requirement are exported. Records with no qualifying notes are excluded from the export.

### Adding New Features
- Routes: Add to appropriate blueprint in `routes/`
- Models: Update `models.py` and create migration
- UI: Modify templates in `templates/`
- Client logic: Update `static/js/app.js`

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues
```bash
# Reset database (WARNING: destroys all data)
rm instance/classification.db
# Database will be recreated automatically when you run the app
python app.py
```

### Port Conflicts
```bash
# Check what's using port 5000
lsof -i :5000

# Use alternative port
python -c "from app import app; app.run(debug=True, port=8080)"
```

### Import Errors
- Ensure XML file is well-formed
- Check that `<record bib="...">` attributes are unique
- Verify note text is properly encoded (UTF-8)
