    <note reviewer="" review="" type="ow">According to scholar Neil Harris, identifiable as the text of a Cisterican or Benedictine Breviary, 4th Sunday after Pentecost. On the front cover the text reads: "hora cene dicere inuitat &lt;,,,&gt; et uenirent quia omnia para &lt;...&gt; a sint alleluia. Benedictus deus" and on the back "Exi cito in plateas &amp; uico &lt;...&gt; uitatis et pauperes ac deb &lt;,,,&gt; es cecos et claudos compelle". For the date, also given that it was still in Italy in quite modern times, can be safely assigned to northern or central Italy in the fifteenth century or very early sixteenth. Though the parchment is old, the binding itself is modern, i.e. early 20th century (just a bit of a falsification, probably done by Martini). The endpapers are on mechanical paper and the edges are not very scuffed. Autograph "J. Martini" of Giuseppe Martini on front paste-down. Manuscript notes (of Martini?) on free front endpaper.</note>

It is requested that those who look into this composition to judge it with compassion and justice not with discontent and prejudice and if they see in it any mistake to correct it, or a blemish to cover it and to hide the bad with the good because no author is immune from making mistakes or writer from shortcomings because human beings are prone to mistakes and forgetfulness specially in this time in which concerns and worries have increased and calamities and sorrows are enormous. We ask God to deliver us from its disasters and to protect us from its implications and that we die protecting His Book and to grnat us to be able to keep it safe and sound and that He may make us and our brethren die as Muslims that we may follow in the path of our rightious and honorable masters. There is no power nor might except in God the most high and the most exalted. May God pray on our master Muḥammad the seal of the prophets and messengers and on his family and all his companions.

We beseech God by the exalted status of Muḥammad, may God pray on him and grant him peace, to gather us, our masters, our loved ones and the author of this copy with those whom God favored of the prophets, the rightious, the martyrs and the virtuous (What good companions those are!) and to protect us with his pleasant cover and to facilitate our matters with rest to our hearts and bodies because He answers invocation and does not turn back he who seeks Him, depends on Him and consigns himself to Him. We beseech God to accept our invokation by the status of the Messenger of God, May God pray on him and grant him peace beause he said: Beseech God in my status because my status is exalted with God. The writing of this book was concluded on Friday the twentieth of the month of Rabīʻ al-Awwal, the year 1293 (GhRJṢ [in alphabetical rconning]) of the Prophetic Hijrah, the best of prayer and peace and the most fragrant greetings be upon its originator. May God pray on our master Muḥammad, his family and his companions and grant them peace. Amen. Amen. Amen. Praise be to God the Lord of the Universe. It is concluded.</note>

May prayer and peace be upon the ʻAdnanite Prophet, his family and his companions to whom God granted Paradise. Thereafter, Muḥammad ʻAlī, nicknamed Abū Sālim, who hopes for the forgiveness from his All Knowing Lord, says: Concluded is -- by the praise of God the bestower of the abundant graces -- the copying of the commentary of the learned scholar Raḍī al-Dīn on al-Shāfiyah. It was edited, explained, revised, elucidated and corrected. This was accomplished on the 28th of Jumād al-Awwal, of the year 1291 of the Hijrah of the One whom God created with perfect character, may God pray upon him and upon his family and those who follow him, as long as night and day alternate and the Moon shines, by the intercession of the the Faithful One.

The collection had been formed by [King] Theodore with the intention of founding a large Library. These books were carried off by our people, and partly given to Abyssinian churches on the march back to Zayla [?], and a number were brought back to England for our own and for foreign libraries. When nearing Zoula on the return march, M. Munzinger, who had charge of the books, found that he had a few to spare, and among them was this Psalter, which he gave to me. -- William Simpson, 2nd April, 1881."; F. 1r: note in the upper margin: ዳዊት ዘ ቅዱስ መድኃኔ ዓለም (this is the statement that the Psalter belonged to the Great Library to be formed at Magdala by Theodore -- W. Simpson); Fine cloth is visible between the paste downs of the front and back cover; The Qalu counting employs the number 9, and does not include the strophes of the Virgin Mary; Blank: ff. iii r, 209v.</note>

    <note reviewer="" review="" type="">Translation of the colophon: "The author, may God have mercy upon him, said: This is the end of Majmaʻ al-baḥrayn wa-multaqá al-nayyirayn. I wrote it according to the rules I established. I endeavored to bring into harmony the diverse quoted issues. I did not leave out of the two books except a few issues which I deliberately discarded, or some issues whose structure I deliberately changed, or to which I added a statement to make them compatible with the soundest and most correct opinions, so that one can be prudent in issuing a fatwá [legal opinion]. I request from those who make copies of the book not to neglect the case-endings of the text because of the many similarities in meanings, especially in the handwritten homonyms, to which caution is definitely recommended. God is to be thanked for His abundant blessings. He is the giver of bliss by His favor and generosity. It is completed. Dated in the year 847 [1443 or 1444]."</note>
